# Webpage structure

When creating a good webpage, each language has a role. The role of HTML is to provide the sections on the page that define what kind of content is displayed. A very important part to understand is that it is not the role of an HTML file to include the content of the page. i.e. the text that you may read on a page.

For this we need to use another source. This may be a database or a file.

For this course we are going to use a syntax called Markdown.

# Markdown

Markdown is as a syntax to write plaintext in a file and by using certain symbols you are able to format the text. The files will be converted into HTML code and that code will eventually be what is displayed to the user.

A markdown file is uses an `.md` extension and from there you can just start writing on the page.

You can find a basic guide to the [syntax here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax)

The content for this course and some others that you take throughout this degree are completely written in markdown.

# GitHub Pages

GitHub is a web based interface to see what happens with the git repository of your content. If your project is a website then you can host this website for free on GitHub using their GitHub Pages service.

GitHub Pages has a number of templates available that you can use to display your content.

You are also able to create your own theme, but we will look into that later on.

To find out how to setup your first GitHub Pages watch [this video](https://youtu.be/BA_c3bGQXlQ) or read [the blogpost](https://programmingliftoff.com/create-your-first-website-on-github-pages/).

# Relation to the assesment

For your first assignment you are to create website using GitHub pages and one of their existing themes. For the second assignment you are to code your own theme using the same content that you are using in assignment 1. So the take away from this is that organising your content is very important. It is separate from the website layout and although the content and layout are mixed in the final product they are delivered separately.
