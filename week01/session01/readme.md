## Key Questions

* What will I learn on this course?
* Why am I learning it?
* How does it fit with the other papers in my qualification?
* Where will it lead?

## How will I learn?
Throughout this course I will be encouraging you to learn by doing. Web development is a practical skill. You cannot learn any practical skill simply by reading about it. Reading books about yoga doesn't help you to touch your toes!

The assessments are designed to show evidence that you have met the learning outcomes of the course. On their own they are not sufficient to make you a web developer. If you are looking to break into industry you will need a portfolio of work to show and talk about. If you haven't already started on this get started today.

Your greatest learning asset is your fellow classmates. Make sure you make the most of them. Team up and get going. Our industry contacts tell us time and time again that they need people who can work in teams. Start treating your study like your job. Make the most of those around you and ensure you participate in return.

Have fun! Your feedback is important if you have any concerns about the course please let me know.

# Software Development Paradigms

* Agile vs Waterfall
* Rapid Application Development

# Coding Standards

In this paper you will be looking a 3 different coding languages, although the syntax of these languages are different for each of them, the coding standards are not. Make sure you stick you to these guidelines and rules to create tidy code.

* All your code must be in lower case, only the text that is displayed on the screen can have uppercase letters in.
* All your file and folder names must be in lowercase
* All file and folder names must a single word or use a `-` symbol to separate the words. **DO NOT USE SPACES**
* All your code must be indented correctly, don't just put code on your page randomly where the spacing makes no sense.

## HTML Specific rules
* Make sure your code has closing tags for the tags that require it.
* Do not put spaces between attribute names and values. i.e. do this: `class="heading"` not this: `class = " heading "`

## CSS specific rules
* the opening curly brace goes on the same line as the selector
* properties are indented from the selector name
* the closing curly brace is to be aligned matching the start of the selector
