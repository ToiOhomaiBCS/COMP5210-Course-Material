# It is not all about the code

There are a number of things to know about before you can and should start to code. They will help you with managing your content and files and others are just some areas you should know about.

# Sitemaps

A sitemap is a diagram that shows what pages of your website are accessible from other pages. The sitemap is not anything fancy, but clarity is key. To create a sitemap you just need a program that can do simple drawings to create boxes and lines.

A couple of options are:

* MS Word (Part of office)
* MS Powerpoint (Part of office)
* Figma.com (Free)
* Draw.io (Free)

There are plenty of other programs out there, but the options above a generally available for free. Here is a more detailed explanation of what a sitemap is and what it is used for.

[https://guide.ireckon.com/how-to-plan-create-a-better-website/site-map/](https://guide.ireckon.com/how-to-plan-create-a-better-website/site-map/)

Note that what we are talking about here is a diagram version of the sitemap that is drawn out.

You can also generate or create an XML version of your Sitemap that is used when you submit your website for SEO on Google, although that is outside of the scope of this course.

# Accessibility

Accessibility is a very important and often overlooked part of web development. The [a11yproject.com](https://a11yproject.com/checklist/) has a checklist with descriptions of the things to watch out for when developing for accesibility. The added benefit of checking your website against this checklist is that it forces you to create your website structurally correct as tools that read your code rely on this and may not neccessarily be able to see your website. 

**Question: what do you think A11Y stands for?**

# UI and UX

UI = User Interface and UX = User experience.

UI is what your website looks like and UX builds along the lines of what the user experiences when they use the website. 

* Is it informative? 
* Does it load quickly? 
* Can a user find the information they are after quickly?

UI and UX have a big role to play in the world of web development, in COMP.5209 you will learn a lot more about this topic.

# Tools to use

## Visual Studio Code - Text Editor

To code HTML, CSS and JavaScript (and any language really) you only need a text editor. Which one you use is ultimately up to you, but there are a lot of editors that offer specific features that can help you out.

In this class we will use Visual Studio Code. The reasons for this are:

* Written and actively supported by supported as an Open Source project.
* Many many many extensions are available to make this editor highly customizable.
* It is free and cross platform
* It has really good support for version control build right into the editor

You can download Visual Studio Code [here from their website](https://code.visualstudio.com)

## Visual Studio Code - Extensions

Visual Studio Code has a vast library of extension to help you with your coding journey. Depending on what it is you are developing you can install different extensions. Although some of the extensions you will use across multiple project types.

A list of some common and good to have extensions are:

* Live Server by ritwickdey.liveserver
* Browser Preview by auchenberg.vscode-browser-preview
* GitLens â€” Git supercharged by eamodio.gitlens

You can look for these in the extension menu on the left of the app, it is the bottom icon.

## Visual Studio Code - Tips

**Open vscode from the command line**
When you use the command line - and you should get comfortable with this - you can navigate to your project folder and start vscode from using the `code .` command. 

**Always work in the context of a folder**
When using vscode you can open files directly using the file > open file option in the menu or by right-clicking on a file from the Windows Explorer window. **YOU SHOULD AVOID BOTH** 

The best way to run vscode is to work from the folder context so you can see your project. If you see a purple bar at the bottom you are not in the folder's context - you need to see a blue bar.


## Git Bash - Version Control

In this course we make extensive use of git as our version control.   
To be able to use git we need to install it onto our system, which you can do from [this website - https://git-scm.com/download](https://git-scm.com/download)

To learn the basic git commands you can look at [these videos](https://git-scm.com/doc) or read [the info](https://github.github.com/training-kit/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf) on this website

Another good video to watch is [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWYqp7iY_Tc) that shows you how to install git on windows and give you a basic overview.

## TIP - BACKUP YOUR WORK

Although the computers in the lab allow you to do all the work you need, **DO NOT RELY ON THEM TO STORE YOUR DATA**!!

You can use git to back up all your coding work and you can also save small files, but there are some limits that you can [read about here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/what-is-my-disk-quota#file-and-repository-size-limitations)

Before the class ends - BACKUP YOUR WORK!!
