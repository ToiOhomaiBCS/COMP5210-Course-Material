# Intro to HTML

This course is set up in a "learn-by-doing" method.

A good course to follow can be found on [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp)

The important take aways for writing HTML code are:

* The language is tag based, everthing that is written between the `<` and the `>` are not displayed on your page
* The homepage should be called **index.html** - nothing else
* To check if the code you are writing is valid use [this website - https://validator.w3.org/](https://validator.w3.org/)

*TIP!* The validator will be used when marking your second assignment, so learn to use it to gain maximum marks

The topics you should have covered at a minimum by the end of the week are:

* [The Basics](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_basic.asp)
* [What are Elements?](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_elements.asp)
* [What are Attributes?](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_attributes.asp)
* [Images](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_images.asp)
* [Headings](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_headings.asp)
* [Paragraphs](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_paragraphs.asp)
* [Tables](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_tables.asp)
* [Hyperlink tags](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_links.asp)
* [Unordered Lists](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_lists.asp)

Eventually you will also need to learn about:

* [Using CSS in HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_css.asp)
* [Using JavaScript in HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_scripts.asp)
* [Semantic Tags](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_layout.asp)
* [HTML Forms](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_forms.asp)

# Don't just use W3Schools

Although w3schools is a very good reference place for a lot of code samples, there are many other places to find this information.

Learning a coding language takes time and the topics above are only an introduction to the language. Keep practicing and try to solve a little problem everyday even if it is a small problem.
